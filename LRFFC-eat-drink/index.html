I want to run some ideas past you and see what you can create to help me bring them to life. I want to create a website that is a resource library for my therapist to go to and use during sessions with clients or even to help them better understand a concept. Some of the content would be LRFFC activities in a game for or matching games at different levels. I would like to create interactive story activities where a client could select the next step in an activity, like washing hands or problem-solving an issue. Or even selecting an appropriate outfit for the weather in that scenario. Are these digital activities you could create? Im thinking practicing safety scenarios in a fun way, or having token boards, customizable visuals chedules and first /then boards. I already started creating a website using Canva. I want to keep it separate from my work accounts so I can bring it with me wherever I go next. 

ChatGPT said:
Yes — these are absolutely digital activities I can help you create.

The main question isn’t “can it be done,” it’s “what’s the cleanest build path given you started in Canva and want this to travel with you.” Here are a few realistic ways to bring this to life, plus exactly what I can generate for you.

What I can create for you (and it can be embedded in your site)
Interactive learning games
LRFFC games

“3 clues → choose 1 of 8” (like you’ve been probing), with adjustable levels (1 clue → 2 clues → 3 clues)

Matching: picture↔word, function↔item, category sorting, feature matching

“Errorless” mode (prompt/highlight correct option first) and “independent” mode

Interactive story / task activities
Choose-the-next-step task chains (washing hands, brushing teeth, packing backpack, crossing street, asking for help)

Problem-solving stories (someone takes toy, denied access, lost item, loud environment, peer conflict)

Weather/outfit selector (scenario shows weather + context → choose appropriate outfit items)

Built to support prompting (visual hints, “try again,” model answer) and data-friendly outputs (simple % correct, trials)

Therapist tools built-in
Token boards (custom token count, token icons, earned/reward visuals)

First/Then boards (swap icons/text instantly, save common sets)

Visual schedules (drag/drop reorder, “check off” as completed)

Choice boards (2–8 options; can randomize or lock)

Printable export for many of these (PDF print button)

Resource library structure
Filterable library by:

skill area (LRFFC / safety / routines / social / coping)

level (early learner → advanced)

format (interactive / printable / video / visual-only)

setting (home / clinic / school / community)

How it would work with your Canva website
Canva sites are great for layout, but the interactive pieces usually live as embeddable widgets.

You’d typically do:

Keep Canva as the “front door” (pretty navigation, categories, buttons).

Each activity is a separate embed page (or link-out page) that runs the game.

You drop it into Canva using an Embed element (or link to it).

I can generate the activities as:

Single-file HTML games (easy to host anywhere)

Or mini web app pages (still simple, but more scalable)

Hosted options: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages (portable + tied to you, not your employer)

This keeps it fully separate from your work accounts and you can move it wherever you go.

A build plan that won’t overwhelm you
If you want momentum fast, do it in “packs”:

Pack 1: Core therapist tools

Token board + First/Then + Visual schedule + Choice board

Pack 2: LRFFC suite

Level 1: 1 clue, array of 4

Level 2: 2 clues, array of 6

Level 3: 3 clues, array of 8

With your preferred “distractors don’t meet criteria” rules

Pack 3: Safety scenarios (game style)

“What should you do?” multiple choice stories

Stop/come here/stay with me

Stranger danger, parking lot, crossing street, lost in store

Reinforcement built-in (token earns, short animation, “great choice”)

Pack 4: Routines + problem solving

Washing hands / getting ready / coping options / peer conflict branching stories

What I need from you (but I’ll still make a strong first draft even if you answer lightly)
If you can answer these in 1–2 lines each, I can start generating the first working prototype:

Audience: ABA clients only, or also outpatient therapy (MFT/psych) clients? Age range?

Device: mostly iPad/tablet during session, or laptop/desktop?

Data: do you want it to store performance (even basic), or just be a tool?

Visual style: super minimal (clean icons), or kid-friendly themed?

Content control: do you want an “admin” way to add your own LRFFC items without coding (like a simple form/JSON list)?

If you want me to “create something right now”
I can start with a working prototype of one activity that matches exactly what you described:

Prototype option A (quick win): LRFFC “3 clues → pick 1 of 8” with level selector and randomized trials.
Prototype option B (flashy win): “Washing Hands: choose the next step” interactive story with prompts + token board.
Prototype option C (most useful daily): Token board + first/then + visual schedule toolbox page.

Tell me which prototype you want first (A/B/C), and I’ll generate the first version you can host and embed into your Canva site.


You said:
Should I tell you all the games I want to add to be specific first or should we do the prototype first?

ChatGPT said:
Prototype first. 💯
Here’s why — and this is especially true for you and how you work.

Why starting with a prototype is the move
It forces clarity: once you see one activity working, it immediately sharpens what you want (and don’t want) for the rest.

Prevents over-engineering: if we list everything first, we’ll design in our heads instead of in the real world.

Creates a reusable “engine”: most of your games will share the same bones (prompting, levels, feedback, tokens). One solid prototype becomes the template for 10+ activities.

Momentum > perfection: you’ll have something usable in sessions fast — not just a big idea.

Think of it like ABA programming: we probe, get baseline data, then build systematically 😉

The best prototype to start with (based on everything you’ve told me)
I strongly recommend starting with one LRFFC game, because:

It’s central to your practice

It naturally scales into multiple levels

It can later plug into safety, routines, and problem-solving

It lets us test:

visuals

response format

prompting hierarchy

therapist usability during live sessions

Prototype we should build first
LRFFC Interactive Game – Level Builder

Core features

1–3 clues (function / feature / class)

Adjustable array size (4, 6, 8)

Click/tap response

Immediate feedback (correct / try again)

Optional prompt mode:

highlight correct

remove distractors

verbal model button

Simple “next trial” flow

Therapist-friendly reset

This becomes the backbone for:

Matching games

Safety decision games

Outfit-for-weather selection

“What should you do next?” stories

What happens after the prototype
Once we finish Prototype 1:

You’ll react to it (this is where your real preferences show up).

We’ll extract a design rule set:

visual style

level progression

how much feedback is too much

how fast trials should move

THEN we list all the games — but now with precision:

“This is LRFFC-style but with branching choices”
“This needs errorless first”
“This is more MFT-leaning, less discrete”

Minimal info I need right now to start
Answer these quickly (no overthinking):

Array size to start: 4, 6, or 8?

Clue presentation: all at once or revealed one at a time?

Feedback tone: neutral (“try again”) or enthusiastic (“nice job!”)?

Device: iPad/tablet or laptop?

Once you answer those four, I’ll build the first prototype — and then after that, we’ll map the full game library with way more confidence.

You’re thinking about this exactly the right way. This has real legs.


You said:
1. We want to start with an array of 4, and the clue presentation should be one at a time, from least to most intrusive. Feedback tone should be neutral for incorrect answers and enthusiastic for correct answers. The device this will be used on varies from phones to laptops. 

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — that actually locks in a very clean, ABA-aligned design. You just made about 10 downstream decisions without realizing it 😄
Here’s what I’m going to build based exactly on what you said, and how we’ll move forward.

Prototype 1: LRFFC Interactive Game (Foundational Engine)
This prototype becomes the core engine everything else plugs into.

1) Trial Structure (least → most intrusive)
Each trial runs like this:

Step 1: Clue 1 appears

Single LRFFC clue (e.g., “You use it to drink”)

Array of 4 images

No highlighting, no prompts

If correct

Enthusiastic feedback (visual + text)

Token earned (if token mode is on)

“Next” button appears

If incorrect

Neutral feedback only

“Try again.”

Step 2: Clue 2 appears

Second clue added (e.g., “It’s made of glass”)

Same array of 4

Still no direct pointing or elimination

Incorrect

Neutral feedback again

Step 3: Clue 3 appears (most intrusive but still naturalistic)

Third clue added (e.g., “It’s in the kitchen”)

Optional visual prompt toggle for therapist:

subtle pulse on correct item

OR removal of 1 distractor (therapist choice)

This mirrors prompt hierarchy without breaking flow.

2) Feedback rules (exactly as you want)
❌ Incorrect → neutral, calm, no punishment language

✅ Correct → enthusiastic:

“Nice job!”

“You got it!”

Optional confetti/animation (can be toggled off)

This keeps it usable for:

early learners

older kids

teens who hate “baby” reinforcement

3) Device flexibility (phone → laptop)
The UI will be:

Tap-friendly

Responsive (auto-resizes grid)

No hover-only features

Works on:

phones

tablets

laptops

clinic smartboards

No logins. No downloads.

4) Therapist controls (hidden, but powerful)
A small “⚙️ Therapist Panel” (can be collapsed):

Restart trial

Reveal next clue manually

Toggle prompts ON/OFF

Toggle token board ON/OFF

Reset tokens

Change stimulus set (later phase)

This makes it session-safe — you’re never stuck mid-trial.

Why this prototype is the right first build
Because once this works, we can reuse the exact logic for:

LRFFC arrays of 6 and 8

Safety scenarios (“Which one is safe?”)

Outfit-for-weather games

Problem-solving choices

Social reasoning (“What should you do next?”)

Even MFT-leaning cognitive choices (with different visuals)

Same engine. Different content.

What I’ll deliver next (step-by-step)
Next response, I’ll give you:

A clear visual wireframe (what the screen looks like)

The exact game logic written out (so you can sanity-check it clinically)

A ready-to-use prototype version you can host and embed into Canva

A short note on:

where to host it

how to embed it

how to duplicate it for future games

Before I generate the actual prototype, I need one tiny preference check (this affects everything):

👉 Do you want the clues displayed as text only, or text + optional audio playback button?

Answer that, and I’ll build the first working version.


You said:
Let's back up really quickly. The levels of the games should allign with the VB-MAPP where applicable. The first milestone for LRFFC would be identifying food or drink items in a field of 5 items. It should ask "Which do you eat or "Which do you drink?" If an incorrect answer is selected, I would want error correction procedures to be followed. We can give an indirect prompt audibly and or provide positional prompts/ grey out the incorrect options on by one until a correct answer is given. If incorrect answer is given, that trial will be rerun later in the trial sequence. The next LRFFC level would be identifying the FFC of items in an array of 8 across 25 different items. Does this clarify what I am looking for? I love all of your ideas but I want it to allign a little closer with this please. 

ChatGPT said:
Yes — that 100% clarifies it, and thank you for stopping us here. This actually makes the project stronger and more clinically defensible. What you just described is not just a “game,” it’s a VB-MAPP–aligned instructional system with built-in error correction and trial management. That’s exactly the right foundation.

Let me reflect back what you want (to make sure we’re perfectly aligned), then I’ll show you how this translates cleanly into a digital build.

What you’re actually building (reframed correctly)
You are not building:

open-ended “educational games”

random matching activities

You are building:

VB-MAPP–aligned LRFFC programs

with specific milestone mapping

error correction procedures

trial recycling

and therapist-controlled prompting

That distinction matters a lot.

LRFFC Level 1 — VB-MAPP–Aligned (Foundational)
Target skill
VB-MAPP Milestone–style LRFFC

Identifying food or drink

Based on function

Discrimination, not naming

Trial format
Field of 5

Items include:

foods

drinks

distractors (non-edible items)

SDs
“Which do you eat?”

“Which do you drink?”

(No compound language, clean verbal operants.)

Response & Error Correction Logic
Correct response

Enthusiastic feedback (as discussed)

Trial marked correct

Move forward

Incorrect response
Error correction sequence begins:

Neutral feedback

“Try again.”

Indirect auditory prompt

Example:

“You eat food… food goes in your mouth.”

No pointing yet

Positional / stimulus prompts

Grey out one incorrect option at a time

Remaining options stay selectable

Until correct response occurs

No skipping

No accidental reinforcement

Trial recycling

That item is flagged

It is reinserted later in the trial sequence

(mimics error correction + distributed practice)

This is textbook ABA, just digitized.

Why this is clinically solid
Matches least-to-most prompting

Prevents error rehearsal

Preserves discrimination learning

Allows for independent responding to reoccur later

Avoids over-prompting early in the trial

This is exactly how a good BT should be running this program.

LRFFC Level 2 — Advanced (VB-MAPP progression)
Target skill
Identify Function / Feature / Class

Array of 8

Across 25 distinct items

Multiple exemplars

No category-only responding

Trial format
1–3 LRFFC clues (depending on level)

Same error correction logic as Level 1

Higher distractor quality (close-but-wrong)

Mastery structure
Items tracked individually

Incorrect trials recycled

Therapist can:

isolate weak items

run “mixed” or “focused” sessions

What this means for the prototype decision
Given this clarification, the correct prototype to build first is:

✅ Prototype 1:
LRFFC Level 1 — Food vs Drink (VB-MAPP aligned)

Why?

It defines:

how SDs are delivered

how errors are handled

how trials are recycled

Every future LRFFC level inherits this logic

Safety scenarios and problem-solving later reuse the same engine

Once this works, scaling to:

Array of 8

25 items

Mixed FFC
is mechanical, not conceptual.

How I would build this digitally (no fluff)
Core engine features
Trial list with randomized order

Error flagging system

Automatic trial reinsertion

Prompt hierarchy toggles

Neutral vs enthusiastic feedback rules

Therapist override panel

Therapist controls
Turn prompts on/off

Choose “food” or “drink” session

Restart flagged trials only

Switch to maintenance mode (no prompts)

Data (optional but future-proof)
% correct

prompted vs independent

items missed
(You can start with no data storage and add later.)

Big reassurance
You did not derail the project — you refined it into something legit. This alignment:

makes it defensible

makes it portable across jobs

and makes it valuable to other clinicians

You’re basically building a VB-MAPP–aligned digital teaching library, not a toy site.

Next step (simple yes/no)
Before I generate the actual Prototype 1, one final clarification:

👉 For Level 1 (food vs drink), do you want pictures only, or pictures + optional spoken SD playback (for clients with weaker attending)?

Answer that, and I’ll build the prototype exactly to spec.


You said:
I would like pictures and optional spoken SD playback. 

ChatGPT said:
Awesome — that’s enough to build Prototype 1 (VB-MAPP LRFFC Level 1: Eat vs Drink, Field of 5) exactly the way you described, with pictures + optional spoken SD playback and your error-correction + trial recycling rules.

Below is a single-file HTML prototype you can host anywhere (GitHub Pages / Netlify / Cloudflare Pages) and then link or embed from your Canva website.

What this prototype includes (matching your spec)
Field of 5

SDs: “Which do you eat?” / “Which do you drink?”

Optional spoken SD playback (uses device text-to-speech)

Error correction:

incorrect → neutral “Try again.”

indirect prompt (text + optional audio)

then grey-out one incorrect option at a time until correct

Trial recycling: any missed trial gets reinserted later

Responsive for phones → laptops

How to use this with your Canva website (quick + portable)
Host the file somewhere you control (best portable options):

GitHub Pages (free, stable)

Netlify (free, easy drag/drop)

Cloudflare Pages (free, very fast)

In Canva:

Either link a button to the hosted URL, OR

Use Canva’s Embed element (if available) to embed the URL.

If you tell me which hosting option you prefer, I’ll give you the exact click-by-click steps for that platform.

Next build (your “Level 2” spec)
Once you confirm this feels right, I’ll clone the same engine into:

Array of 8

25-item bank

“Function / Feature / Class” clue modes

Therapist control for:

1 clue vs 2 vs 3 clues

prompt types (grey-out vs positional vs highlight)

mastery tracking by item

If you want one small tweak before we call Prototype 1 “done”:
Do you want the spoken SD to auto-play at the start of each trial, or only when you press 🔊 Play SD?


You said:
Press play SD. Can you walk me through adding it to my git hub. I already have one game in my repository. Im still new to using it. 

ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — I’ve got you. We’ll do this slow, concrete, and no assumptions, and I’ll frame it so it feels repeatable (because you will add more games later).

You already did the hard part by having a repo and one game in it 👍

Big picture (what you’re doing)
You are:

adding one new HTML file (this LRFFC game)

to an existing GitHub repository

and letting GitHub Pages host it

so Canva can link to it

No coding changes needed beyond pasting the file.

Step 1: Make sure GitHub Pages is actually ON (one-time check)
Go to github.com and open your repository

Click Settings (top right of the repo)

In the left sidebar, click Pages

Under Source, confirm:

Branch: main

Folder: /root

Click Save if it isn’t already set

✅ Once this is on, every HTML file in your repo becomes a live webpage.

Your site URL will look like:

https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/
Keep that handy.

Step 2: Add the LRFFC game file to your repo (the safe way)
Since you’re new, I recommend uploading via the browser, not Git.

Option A: Upload through GitHub website (easiest)
Open your repository

Click Add file → Upload files

On your computer:

Create a new file named:

lrffc-eat-drink.html
Paste the full prototype code I gave you

Save the file

Drag that file into the upload area

Scroll down

Under Commit changes:

Commit message:

Add LRFFC Level 1 Eat vs Drink game
Leave everything else default

Click Commit changes

🎉 That’s it — the file is now live-capable.

Step 3: Get the live URL for the game
Once the file is committed:

Click on lrffc-eat-drink.html in your repo

Look at the file path — it should be at the root

Your live URL will be:

https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/lrffc-eat-drink.html
👉 Paste that into a new browser tab to test it
(It may take 30–60 seconds the first time.)

If it loads — you’re golden.

Step 4: Link it from Canva
Option 1: Button link (recommended)
Add a Button in Canva

Set link to:

https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/lrffc-eat-drink.html
Label ideas:

“LRFFC: Eat vs Drink”

“Food vs Drink (VB-MAPP Level 1)”

Option 2: Embed (if Canva allows on your plan)
Add Embed element

Paste the same URL

Resize frame

(Button is more reliable across devices.)

Step 5: How you’ll add future games (important mental model)
From now on, every game is just:

1 HTML file

Uploaded to the same repo

Linked the same way

Example future files:

lrffc-ffc-array8.html
safety-cross-the-street.html
routine-wash-hands.html
token-board.html
Your GitHub repo becomes your private game library backend
Your Canva site becomes your front-end menu.

This is exactly what you said you wanted: portable, employer-independent, scalable.

Common beginner issues (so you don’t panic later)
❌ “404 not found”
→ Wait 1 minute, refresh, confirm Pages is on

❌ Game loads but no audio
→ Browser requires user interaction (you already chose “Press Play SD,” so you’re safe)

❌ Emojis instead of images
→ Totally fine for now; we’ll swap in real images later

Next logical upgrades (when you’re ready)
Not now — just planting seeds:

Replace emoji with real photo stimuli

Clone this file → build array of 8

Add therapist-only mastery toggles

Create a shared visual style across games

Add a “VB-MAPP Level” label on each game

If you want, next we can:

Walk through organizing your repo cleanly

Convert this into LRFFC Level 2

Or design your site map so this feels like a legit resource library

You’re doing this right, not rushed — and it shows.


You said:
It just showed up a the code

ChatGPT said:
Yep — that’s normal inside GitHub. When you click the file in your repo, GitHub shows the source code view (the “blob” page), not the hosted webpage.

What you want is the GitHub Pages URL, not the GitHub file URL.

1) First, confirm GitHub Pages is turned on
Repo → Settings → Pages

Source: Deploy from a branch

Branch: main

Folder: / (root)

Save

Once it’s enabled, GitHub will show a box that says something like:
“Your site is published at …” (that link is your base Pages URL)

2) Use the Pages URL + your filename
Your working game link should be:

https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/lrffc-eat-drink.html

Example:
https://emilymaxey.github.io/aba-library/lrffc-eat-drink.html

Common mistake
If your link looks like this, it will show code:

https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO/blob/main/lrffc-eat-drink.html

That’s the GitHub file viewer.

3) Quick way to get the correct link (no guessing)
In your repo, click Settings → Pages

Copy the published site URL (base)

Add /lrffc-eat-drink.html to the end

4) If it still doesn’t load as a page
Check these fast:

Is the file actually named exactly lrffc-eat-drink.html (no .txt at the end)?

Is it in the root of the repo (not inside a folder)?

If it’s inside /games/, the URL becomes:
https://username.github.io/repo/games/lrffc-eat-drink.html

If you paste the link you’re clicking (the one showing code), I’ll tell you the exact corrected Pages link immediately.


You said:
Uploaded image

ChatGPT said:
Ah — this screenshot helps a lot. 👍
You’re very close, and this is a super common GitHub Pages gotcha.

What’s actually wrong (the key insight)
Your page is loading, but the browser is treating the file as plain text, not as HTML.

The giveaway is this:

Your page is showing

!doctype html html lang=en head meta charset=utf-8 ...
Notice what’s missing: the < > brackets are gone

That means GitHub Pages is serving the file as text, not rendering it as a webpage.

This happens for one of three reasons — and I’m 99% sure it’s #1.

Fix checklist (do these in order)
✅ FIX 1 (most likely): The file is not actually .html
GitHub will happily display code even if the file is really:

lrffc-eat-drink.html.txt

lrffc-eat-drink.md

or was created via “Add file → Create new file” with markdown formatting

How to confirm
In your repo, click the file name

Look at the tab title and file path

It must end exactly in:

lrffc-eat-drink.html
If you see anything like .txt or .md, that’s the problem.

The fix
Safest method (recommended):

On your computer:

Create a new file called

lrffc-eat-drink.html
Paste the code again (make sure <html> and <head> are present)

In GitHub:

Delete the broken file

Upload the new .html file via Add file → Upload files

Commit

⏱ Wait ~30 seconds and refresh the Pages URL.

✅ FIX 2: The file was auto-escaped when pasted
Sometimes when people use “Create new file”, GitHub interprets pasted content as markdown and escapes HTML.

If you did use “Create new file” instead of “Upload files”, this is likely.

Solution: upload the file instead of pasting it.

✅ FIX 3: Pages source folder mismatch (less likely, but check)
Your URL shows:

ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/lrffc-eat-drink.html
That means:

Repo name = ProgramLinks

File location = root of repo

Confirm in Settings → Pages:

Source: main

Folder: / (root)

If the file lives inside a folder like /ProgramLinks/, then the URL would need:

/ProgramLinks/ProgramLinks/lrffc-eat-drink.html
But based on your URL, this part looks correct.

How to know it’s fixed (instant confirmation)
When it’s working, you will see:

Cards

Buttons

Emojis as pictures

NOT raw text

If you still see code, the browser is still reading it as text.

If you want the nuclear “this will 100% work” method
Tell me:

Did you upload the file or paste it in GitHub?

What exactly does the filename show in the repo?

Or paste just the first 3 lines of the file as GitHub shows it, and I’ll spot the issue instantly.

You’re not doing anything wrong — this is a classic first-GitHub-Pages trap, and once it’s fixed, every future game will be smooth sailing.


You said:
How do you make an HTML file? Can you make a downloadable version and I will then upload it to git

ChatGPT said:
Yes — that’s the cleanest fix. 👍
I’ll walk you through exactly how to make an HTML file on your computer (no coding background needed), then how to upload it to GitHub. Once you do it this way once, everything will click.

Part 1: How to make an HTML file (step-by-step, no guesswork)
Option A (recommended): Using Notepad / TextEdit
This avoids GitHub’s auto-formatting issues.

On Windows (Notepad)
Right-click anywhere on your desktop

Click New → Text Document

Name it exactly:

lrffc-eat-drink.html
⚠️ Important:

You must delete .txt

When Windows warns you, click Yes

Right-click → Open with → Notepad

Paste the entire game code I gave you (I’ll repost it below)

Click File → Save

Close Notepad

✅ You now have a real HTML file.

On Mac (TextEdit)
Open TextEdit

In the top menu, click Format → Make Plain Text

Paste the full code

Click File → Save

Name it:

lrffc-eat-drink.html
Under Format, choose:

Plain Text

Save

⚠️ If macOS adds .txt anyway:

Finder → Right-click file → Rename

Remove .txt

Part 2: Upload the HTML file to GitHub (this avoids ALL problems)
Go to your GitHub repo:
ehamp003 / ProgramLinks

Click Add file → Upload files

Drag lrffc-eat-drink.html into the box

Scroll down

Commit message:

Add LRFFC Level 1 Eat vs Drink game
Click Commit changes

⏱ Wait ~30–60 seconds.

Part 3: Open the correct live link (this matters)
Your working link will be:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/lrffc-eat-drink.html
🔁 Hard refresh if needed:

Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R

Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

If it works, you’ll see:

Buttons

Emojis

White cards

NOT code

Part 4: Why this will fix your issue (important reassurance)
What went wrong earlier:

GitHub escaped your pasted HTML

The browser read it as text

That’s why the < > vanished

Uploading a real .html file forces GitHub Pages to render it correctly.

This is the correct workflow for all future games.

Part 5: Your reusable workflow going forward
Every new game will be:

Copy an existing .html file

Rename it (e.g. lrffc-array8.html)

Edit content

Upload to GitHub

Link in Canva

That’s it. No Git commands. No terminal.

If you want, I can also:
Re-post the full HTML code again so you can copy cleanly

Help you organize your repo (folders vs root)

Create a Level 2 LRFFC file ready to drop in

Or build a token board / first-then board next

Tell me which you want next — but first, make that file and upload it.
Once it renders, you’re officially past the hardest part 🚀


You said:
Gave me a 404 file not found page

ChatGPT said:
Got it — 404 on GitHub Pages almost always means one of these:

The file isn’t actually in the place Pages is serving from (root vs /docs)

The filename/path doesn’t match exactly (case-sensitive + folder-sensitive)

GitHub Pages isn’t publishing from the branch/folder you think

The repo is publishing, but the file is in a subfolder so the URL needs that folder

Let’s fix it fast with the least steps.

Step 1: Confirm the file is actually in the repo (root level)
Open your repo code view (not Pages):

GitHub → your repo → “Code” tab

Do you see lrffc-eat-drink.html listed right there in the top-level file list?

✅ If YES → go to Step 2

❌ If NO → the upload didn’t land where you think. Re-upload it and make sure you hit Commit changes.

Common gotcha: it uploaded into a folder like /games/ or /ProgramLinks/.

If it’s inside a folder (example: games/lrffc-eat-drink.html), your Pages URL must be:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/games/lrffc-eat-drink.html

(Notice the folder in the middle.)

Step 2: Copy the exact file path and build the correct URL
When you click the file in GitHub, look near the top — it shows the path like:

ProgramLinks / lrffc-eat-drink.html ✅ (root)

or ProgramLinks / games / lrffc-eat-drink.html ✅ (folder)

Then your live URL is:

Base:
https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/

Plus the path:

root file → lrffc-eat-drink.html

folder file → games/lrffc-eat-drink.html

Step 3: Check GitHub Pages settings (this causes 404 a LOT)
Repo → Settings → Pages

Look at Build and deployment:

You want:
Source: Deploy from a branch

Branch: main

Folder: / (root)

If your folder is set to /docs, then GitHub Pages will only publish what’s inside a folder named docs.

So either:

change Folder to / (root) OR

move your file into /docs/ and then the URL becomes the same but it’s being served correctly.

Step 4: Make sure your repo name matches the URL
Your URL in the screenshot earlier was:

ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/lrffc-eat-drink.html

So the repo must be named exactly ProgramLinks (capital L).
GitHub Pages URLs are case-sensitive sometimes depending on how it’s served — safest is: match exact capitalization.

The quickest way to solve this in one shot
Do this and tell me what you see:

Go to your repo Code tab

Look at the top-level file list and answer:

Do you see lrffc-eat-drink.html right there? (yes/no)

If no: what folder is it in?

If you want, you can paste one of these and I’ll give you the exact correct Pages link immediately:

the GitHub file URL (github.com/.../blob/main/...)

OR a screenshot of your repo file list showing where the file is

We’ll get it live in the next step.

ChatGPT said:
PERFECT screenshot — this tells us exactly what’s wrong, and the good news is:
👉 your file structure is correct
👉 your URL is correct
👉 GitHub Pages is just pointing at the wrong folder

This is a classic Pages configuration issue, not a mistake on your end.

What’s happening (plain English)
Your repo looks like this (from your screenshot):

ProgramLinks/
├── LRFFC-eat-drink/
│   └── index.html   ✅
├── lrffc-game/
├── README.md
You are going to this URL (also correct):

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/index.html
But GitHub Pages is saying “404” because:

GitHub Pages is NOT currently publishing from the repo root

It’s almost certainly set to publish from /docs (or an old folder) instead of /.

The fix (2 minutes, no code)
Step 1: Open GitHub Pages settings
In your repo, click Settings

Click Pages in the left sidebar

Step 2: Fix the Pages source (this is the key step)
Under Build and deployment, set:

Source: Deploy from a branch

Branch: main

Folder: / (root) ← THIS PART MATTERS

Then click Save

⏱ GitHub will take ~30–60 seconds to redeploy.

You may see a green check or a message like:

“Your site is published at https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/”

Step 3: Reload your game URL
After waiting a minute, go back to:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/index.html
If needed:

Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

Why this works
GitHub Pages only serves one folder.

Right now it’s serving:

❌ a folder that does NOT contain your game

We’re changing it to serve:

✅ the repo root, which does contain LRFFC-eat-drink/index.html

Once that’s set:

Any folder with an index.html becomes a live page

Your structure is actually ideal for a game library

Bonus: the even cleaner URL (optional)
Once Pages is set to root, you can also use:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/
GitHub automatically loads index.html inside the folder.

This is the URL you’ll want to paste into Canva buttons.

You are actually doing this RIGHT
Just to zoom out for a second:

You created a modular folder per game ✅

You named files correctly (index.html) ✅

You’re separating games cleanly ✅

This will scale beautifully when you have:

/safety-cross-street/

/token-board/

/lrffc-array8/

You were blocked by one Pages dropdown, not a skills gap.

Do this one thing now:
👉 Go to Settings → Pages → change Folder to / (root) → Save

Then tell me what you see when you reload the link.
If it still doesn’t load, I’ll stay with you and we’ll fix it live — but this should be the final unlock 🔓


You said:

ChatGPT said:
YES — this screenshot is the green light. 🎉
Everything is now configured correctly.

You are officially past the hard part.

Now let’s do the last 2 things that trip people up: URL format + deployment delay.

What your screenshot confirms (important)
From your Pages settings:

✅ Deploy from a branch

✅ Branch: main

✅ Folder: / (root)

✅ Site published at:
https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/

This means GitHub Pages is now serving exactly the folder your game lives in.

The correct URL for your game (this is the key)
Your game is here in the repo:

ProgramLinks /
└── LRFFC-eat-drink /
    └── index.html
So the correct live URL is:

👉 Use THIS (clean version):

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/
You do not need to add index.html at the end anymore.

GitHub Pages automatically loads it.

Why you may still see 404 for a minute
GitHub Pages redeploys in the background. Even though it says “live,” it can take:

⏱ 30 seconds to 2 minutes

Sometimes a hard refresh is needed

Do this exactly:
Open a new tab

Paste:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/
Hard refresh:

Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R

Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

If it still shows 404 after 2 minutes (rare, but easy fix)
One last thing to check:

Confirm filename casing
Inside the LRFFC-eat-drink folder:

File must be named exactly:

index.html
Not:

Index.html

index.HTML

GitHub Pages is case-sensitive.

From your screenshot, it is correct — I’m mentioning this just in case.

What you should see when it works
You’ll know it’s live because you’ll see:

White card layout

“Which do you eat?” text

Buttons

Emojis as pictures

If you see anything other than that, tell me what you see.

🎉 Big picture moment (you should feel proud)
You now have:

A modular game folder

Hosted on your own GitHub Pages

Portable across jobs

Ready to link in Canva

Scalable to dozens of ABA tools

This is exactly how professional resource libraries are built — you just did it without a dev team.

Next (your choice):
Link this into Canva (I’ll help you label it cleanly)

Clone this into LRFFC Level 2 (array of 8, 25 items)

Build your token board / first-then board

Organize your repo so it feels like a polished library

First — try the clean URL above and tell me what loads 👀


You said:
It is still showing up as an error and I have tried all youve suggested

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 21s
Okay — since you’ve tried the refresh / URL / casing stuff and it’s still throwing the GitHub Pages “File not found” 404, we’re past the easy mistakes. Your screenshots give us enough to troubleshoot the real causes.

From what you showed, the two most common “still 404” causes at this point are:

The Pages settings change wasn’t actually saved / deployed (even if it looks like it is)

The repo is Private and your GitHub plan/settings aren’t allowing Pages to serve it publicly (this is very common)

Let’s diagnose this in the fastest, most decisive way.

Step A — Click the “Visit site” button (this bypasses URL guessing)
On the Settings → Pages screen you showed, there should be a “Visit site” button near the “Your site is live at …” line.

Click Visit site

What happens?

If Visit site opens a 404 page → the deployment itself is not publishing your files

If Visit site works but your folder URL doesn’t → it’s a path/case mismatch

If Visit site works only when logged in → it’s a repo visibility/permissions issue

Step B — Check if your repo is PUBLIC (this is the #1 “why is Pages 404?” after setup)
Go to:

Repo → Settings → General

Near the top (or in the right column), it will show:

Public or Private

If it’s Private:
Make it Public (at least while you’re using GitHub Pages the simple way).

Repo → Settings → General → scroll to “Danger Zone” → Change repository visibility → Public

Why: GitHub Pages can fail/404 when the repo is private depending on plan/config, even if Pages looks “enabled.”

(You can always switch to a different hosting approach later if you need it private.)

Step C — Verify the deployment actually succeeded (this is the “truth serum”)
Go to:

Repo → Actions

Look for a workflow called something like:

pages build and deployment

Deploy static content to Pages

Click the most recent run.

What you want to see:
✅ green check / “completed”

and in the summary, a link like “View deployment”

If it’s red / failed / or there is no pages deployment at all, that explains the 404 instantly.

Step D — Your correct link (based on your folder structure)
Your folder is: LRFFC-eat-drink
Your file inside it is: index.html

So the link should be exactly:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/
If Pages is truly publishing from root, that must work.

The most likely fix based on your screenshots
If I had to bet based on “everything looks right but still 404,” it’s this:

✅ The repo is Private, so Pages is not serving the project the way you expect.
Switching to Public usually fixes it immediately (sometimes after 1–2 minutes).

Do this now (2-minute sequence)
Repo → Settings → General → confirm Public or Private

Repo → Actions → confirm latest Pages deployment is ✅

Go to:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/
If you reply with just two things, I can tell you the exact fix instantly:

Is the repo Public or Private?

In Actions, do you see a green ✅ “pages build and deployment” run?


You said:

Uploaded image

ChatGPT said:
Great — your screenshots confirm two huge things:

✅ Your repo is public

✅ Your GitHub Pages root is loading (it shows “ProgramLinks”)

So Pages is working. That means the remaining problem is only the path to the folder/page.

And your earlier screenshot shows the folder is named:

LRFFC-eat-drink (capital LRFFC)

GitHub Pages paths can be case-sensitive and exact. Also, if you renamed anything recently, Pages may still be serving an older build for that subpath until a fresh deploy happens.

Let’s fix this in the most bulletproof way:

1) Use the exact folder name (copy/paste this)
Try this exact URL:

(no index.html)

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/
Then try this exact URL:

(with index.html)

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/index.html
If both still 404, we’ll do Step 2.

2) Force GitHub Pages to “see” the folder by adding a root index that links to it
Right now your repo root likely doesn’t have a proper index.html that links to your game folder.

We’ll create a simple homepage that lists your games and links directly. This also makes Canva easier.

Do this:
Go to your repo Code tab (top level of ProgramLinks)

Click Add file → Create new file

Name it exactly:

index.html
Paste this (simple launcher page):

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
  <title>ProgramLinks</title>
  <style>
    body{font-family:system-ui,Arial,sans-serif;margin:24px;max-width:800px}
    a{display:block;padding:12px 14px;border:1px solid #ddd;border-radius:12px;text-decoration:none;margin:10px 0}
    a:hover{background:#f7f7f9}
    h1{margin:0 0 12px}
    p{color:#555;margin:0 0 16px}
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>ProgramLinks</h1>
  <p>Select an activity:</p>

  <a href="./LRFFC-eat-drink/">LRFFC Level 1 — Eat vs Drink</a>

</body>
</html>
Scroll down → Commit changes

Now wait 30–60 seconds and open:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/
Click the link on that page.

✅ If the link works from there, it means the folder path is correct and Pages is serving it.
If it still 404s from the homepage link, then Pages is not deploying that folder’s contents (rare, but then Step 3 will solve it).

3) If it STILL 404s: confirm the folder name as Pages sees it
Sometimes a folder can look like LRFFC-eat-drink in GitHub UI but actually be LRFFC-eat-drink (hidden space) or have different capitalization from a rename.

Do this quick check:

In GitHub repo, click the folder LRFFC-eat-drink

Look at the breadcrumb at the top — it will show the exact folder name

Click into the folder and click index.html

In the address bar on GitHub (not Pages), copy the folder name portion exactly.

Based on what I see, the “launcher index.html” (Step 2) will resolve this 99% of the time.
It also gives you a clean “library” landing page, which is what you want long-term anyway.

If you do Step 2 and paste me a screenshot of the new root page after it deploys, I’ll tell you exactly what to click / what the final Canva link should be.


You said:
Is there another way to do this or can I delete the repo and start over again?

ChatGPT said:
Yes — you can absolutely delete and start over, and honestly that’s a totally reasonable move if GitHub is feeling like quicksand right now.

But before you nuke it, here are two easier paths (one of them requires basically zero GitHub knowledge), and then I’ll give you the clean “start over” steps if you still want that.

Option 1: The easiest way (no GitHub pain) — Netlify drag-and-drop
This is the fastest “I just want it to work” option.

On your computer, create a folder called LRFFC-eat-drink

Put your index.html inside that folder

Go to Netlify and use “Deploy manually / drag and drop”

Drag the folder (or a zipped folder) into Netlify

It gives you a live link immediately

✅ Pros: dead simple, works every time, perfect for your “library of games”
⚠️ Cons: you’ll manage files via uploads (still fine for you)

If you want, I’ll tell you the exact folder layout that makes your links super clean.

Option 2: Keep GitHub, but make it foolproof (no deleting)
You’re so close already because your root site loads. The issue is just that Pages isn’t serving the subfolder the way you expect.

The most reliable GitHub structure is:

ProgramLinks/
  index.html
  LRFFC-eat-drink/
    index.html
  lrffc-game/
    index.html
Then your links are always:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/

If you add a simple index.html at the repo root that links to your games, GitHub Pages tends to behave consistently.

Option 3: Delete the repo and start over (yes, you can)
If you want a clean slate, here’s the clean way to do it.

A) Delete the repo
Repo → Settings

Scroll to Danger Zone

Delete this repository

Type the repo name to confirm

B) Create a fresh repo (recommended settings)
GitHub → New repository

Name it: ProgramLinks (same is fine)

Make it Public

Check Add a README (optional but helps)

Create repo

C) Add your first game (best practice from day 1)
Upload this exact structure:

Create a folder: LRFFC-eat-drink

Inside it: index.html (your game)

Then upload both:

LRFFC-eat-drink/index.html

(optional but recommended) a root index.html homepage that links to games

D) Turn on Pages
Repo → Settings → Pages

Deploy from branch

Branch: main

Folder: / (root)

Save

Then your live game URL becomes:
https://YOURNAME.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/

My recommendation (based on your goal: portable, low stress)
If your priority is “I want this to work reliably and not eat my life”:

Netlify drag-and-drop is the calmest solution.

If your priority is “I want everything versioned and scalable long-term”:

Keep GitHub, but add a root index.html library page.

If you tell me which route you want (Netlify vs restart GitHub), I’ll give you the exact step-by-step with the least clicks possible.


You said:
Now it is just a blank white page even when using it as a link for the site

ChatGPT said:

Thought for 15s
A blank white page usually means the HTML file is loading, but the content isn’t actually in the file that GitHub Pages is serving (or the browser is hitting a different file than you think). The nice part: this is easy to pinpoint in 60 seconds.

1) Do this first: “View page source” on the blank page
Open the blank page in Chrome → right-click → View page source.

You’ll get one of two outcomes:

A) The source is basically empty / tiny
That means GitHub Pages is serving an index.html that doesn’t contain your game code (wrong file, wrong folder, or overwritten).

B) The source shows your full HTML (lots of code)
Then it’s likely a JavaScript error preventing the page from rendering properly in your browser (less common with this build, but possible if something got pasted/edited wrong).

Tell me which you see (A or B).
If you want, paste the first ~10 lines of the page source.

2) The most common cause in your setup
From your earlier screenshot, your game lives here:

ProgramLinks / LRFFC-eat-drink / index.html

A blank page often happens if you accidentally created/edited a different index.html (like the repo root index.html) and not the one inside the folder.

Quick check inside GitHub
Go to your repo → click folder LRFFC-eat-drink → click index.html.

Do you see the full game code there?

Specifically: do you see <div class="wrap"> and the big block of JavaScript at the bottom?

If that folder index.html is empty or just a few lines, that’s your blank page.

3) Make sure you’re using the correct live URL
For a folder game, use the folder URL:

✅ Use:

https://ehamp003.github.io/ProgramLinks/LRFFC-eat-drink/
(That loads /LRFFC-eat-drink/index.html automatically.)

4) Fast “known-good” test (to prove the path is correct)
Replace the contents of LRFFC-eat-drink/index.html temporarily with this tiny test page:

<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head><meta charset="utf-8"><title>Test</title></head>
  <body style="font-family:system-ui; padding:24px;">
    <h1>LRFFC-eat-drink is LIVE ✅</h1>
    <p>If you can see this, the URL/path is correct.</p>
  </body>
</html>
Commit, refresh the live URL.

If you see the test page: path is correct → we just need to put the full game code back in the right file.

If still blank: something else is intercepting (rare) — then we check Console.

5) If page source shows full code but it’s still blank
Open DevTools console:

Windows: Ctrl + Shift + J

Mac: Cmd + Option + J

If you see a red error, screenshot it and send it — I’ll tell you exactly what to change.

Quick question that will let me fix this immediately:
Paste the exact URL that is showing the blank page (copy from the address bar).
